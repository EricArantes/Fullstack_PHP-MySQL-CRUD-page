https://juniortest-eric-arantes.000webhostapp.com/

The page can be viewed following the link above.

A fully functional page where a user can add products to a database, the page connects to a Mysql database and uses PHP for the back end.

The page was coded using OOP principles and procedural php code is used exclusively to initialize classes.
Classes extend each other and the code meets PSR-4 standards.

There is one endpoint for saving products and the user can choose which product type to save by using a selector, the page avoids using conditional statements to handle differences between product types.
